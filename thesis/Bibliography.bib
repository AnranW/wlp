abstract="With respect to substitution and replacement, two extreme attitudes seem to prevail. Either the manipulations are deemed so simple that the author performs them without any explanation or statement of the rules, or the author tries to give a precise statement of the most general rules and ends up with 200 pages of small print, in which all simplicity has been lost. Neither is entirely satisfactory for the purposes of this little monograph.",
