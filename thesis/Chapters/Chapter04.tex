\section{Conclusions}
In this thesis, I study the weakest liberal precondition transformer and its over-approximation: $G$ such that $wlp.C.F\implies G$. 
I first discuss the definitions of while-loops in its original form~\cite{dijkstra75} and a variant using fixed points. 
I establish an equivalence between the two forms of definitions, validating the prudence of the second version. 
Subsequently, I investigate the $G$ in question. 
Coincidentally, supplementing $G$ with extra restraints using the strongest postcondition transformer, $G$ coincides with the weakest liberal precondition transformer with angelic non-determinism: 
$$(sp.C.\neg G {\implies} \neg F) \wedge
(P{\implies} G \implies \neg(sp.C.P {\implies} \neg F) )
\implies\ G = wlp_a.C.F$$

However, without extra constraints, $G$ can be a precondition where all executions are possible. 
The only certainty is that \hoare{\neg G}{C}{\neg F} is a valid Hoare Triple. 
Regardless, $G$ still finds its usefulness while trying to identify preconditions that lead to erroneous final states, but without sufficient knowledge of all the undesired final states. 
One first finds the weakest liberal precondition with respect to the known ``bad'' final states, then over-approximate the found precondition by ``guessing'' more possible unwanted final states. 

\section{Future Work}
This thesis is only concerned with binary predicates, i.e. a predicate that evaluates to either $true$ or $false$. 
Albeit classic, it might be more interesting to examine the above results in a quantitative setting, where predicates evaluate to more than $true$ or $false$. 
In a quantitative setting, the notion of angelic or demonic non-determinism might be too absolute. 
Instead of regarding the non-determinism as completely in or against our favor, which are strong assumptions, what are the implications when the non-determinism resolves partially in or against our favor?
