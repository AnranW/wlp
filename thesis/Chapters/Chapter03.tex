\section{Goal: A Proof System}
This thesis aims to study the necessary liberal precondition(quantity) and its relation to Hoare Triple. 
In their paper, Cousot et al. studied the necessary preconditions and proposed static analysis rules with inference tools.
We aim to research the same subject with a more theoretical approach in the flavor of \cite{Vries2011}.
Instead of defining big-step semantics, we use GCL and hopefully to come up with a proof system,
and by doing so with GCL syntax, we hope to prove the completeness and soundness of the proof system using structural induction.
Finally, we will look for interesting use cases demonstrating the necessary liberal precondition reasoning techniques and how they differ from other systems.
